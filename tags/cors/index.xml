I finally made myself clear after having been struggling half a hour about this saying:
Cross-origin writes are typically allowed&amp;hellip;.
Cross-origin embedding is typically allowed&amp;hellip;.
Cross-origin reads are typically not allowed&amp;hellip;
To better understand with these three phrases, the first thing you need to keep in mind is that same-origin policy is about restricting access the loaded result from one origin to another origin, within your browser, so it does nothing directly to do with cross-origin requesting, which involves requesting to the server.</description></item></channel></rss>
