Number of connections to master and slave nodes For each node there are two connection related metrics: NewConnections and CurrConnections.
NewConnections, AWS ElastiCache derives this by subtracting two consecutive samples of the total_connections_received stats of a redis node. CurrConnections, this metric is derived directly from the redis stats connected_clients which contains the number of client connections(excluding the connections from replicas) Redirect &amp;gt; Normally slave nodes will redirect clients to the authoritative master for the hash slot involved in a given command, however clients can use slaves in order to scale reads using theREADONLY command.</description></item></channel></rss>
