## Relating concepts

### Gold grade

> Gold grade is a term used in gold mining, and should be used as a measure of the quality of gold ore – that is the raw material obtained from mining.
>
> The grade of mined, raw gold ore is measured in grams of gold per tonne of ore. High grade gold ore contains more gold per tonne; this means that more gold is obtained from every tonne mined. This greatly increases the profitability of a mine. Indeed, the high cost of processing extremely low grade ore may actually make mining financially unfeasible.[1]

**What's the average grade of all gold deposits in the world**

> In fact, in our 2013 report summarizing the world’s gold deposits, we found that the average grade of gold deposits in the world is around that amount: about 1.01 g/t.

### Gold purity

> Pure gold is extremely soft and malleable. It is because of this that manufacturers, typically jewellers, often mix or alloy pure gold with other harder base metals. Without knowing a gold article’s precious metal content it is difficult to arrive at a true valuation.
>
> To quantify this there are two major systems that measure purity. They are carat (karat in the US), and fineness. Both carat and fineness give figures that indicate the proportion of pure gold to other base metals in gold jewellery and products.

### Ounce and Troy Ounce

1 Troy Ounce == 31 grams
1 Ounce == 28 grams

When measuring precious metal we always use troy ounce.

### Density of gold

19.3 g/cc

or

19.3 ton/m^3

## How much gold has been mined so far?

> The best estimates currently available suggest that around 197,576 tonnes of gold has been mined throughout history, of which around two-thirds has been mined since 1950. And since gold is virtually indestructible, this means that almost all of this metal is still around in one form or another. If every single ounce of this gold were placed next to each other, the resulting cube of pure gold would only measure around 21 metres on each side.[2]

The quote states the data by end of 2019, according to the density of gold, 197,576 tonnes corresponds to a 21.7 metre sides cube.

## Wait, are you saying all of the golds we have mined only fit a 21.7 metre sides cube?

Yes, 21.7 metre sides cube is roughly equal to 3 olympic standard pools, I could hardly believed it at first, but that's true. Ref3 shows a great visualization of how big a 21.7m^3 cube is, you might find yourself underestimate a 21.7m^3 cube there.

## Ok, now How much gold is being mined each year?

> Each year, global gold mining adds approximately 2,500-3,000 tonnes to the overall above-ground stock of gold. While gold production has shown an upward trend in recent years, this is likely to level off in coming years.

## Who are mining the gold now?


## How much gold is still left there to be mined?

There are two aspects for this question.

The first is that the gold deposits that have already been discovered by the above companies are still being mined, if you remember we have mentioned at the begining that the average grade of a gold mine is just 1.01g/ton, which means mining a ton of ore only gets 1.01 gram of gold. So a gold deposit costs decades to be carven out.

And the second point is as describe below which quotes from Ref4

> It’s also important to remember that the total amount of gold in the Earth’s crust and the total amount that can be feasibly mined are not the same. There are almost certainly massive gold deposits deep beneath the surface of the Earth that are too far down to be detected, let alone extracted.
>
> Similarly, there are some known gold deposits in Antarctica that may never be economical to mine due to the continent’s extreme weather conditions and the challenges presented by thick ice layers.
>
> There is also a considerable amount of gold that cannot be collected profitably scattered throughout the world’s oceans. Much of these underwater deposits are contained within the ocean floor and floating as tiny particles in the seawater itself.
