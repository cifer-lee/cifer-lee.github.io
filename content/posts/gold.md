## Relating concepts

### Gold grade

> Gold grade is a term used in gold mining, and should be used as a measure of the quality of gold ore – that is the raw material obtained from mining.
>
> The grade of mined, raw gold ore is measured in grams of gold per tonne of ore. High grade gold ore contains more gold per tonne; this means that more gold is obtained from every tonne mined. This greatly increases the profitability of a mine. Indeed, the high cost of processing extremely low grade ore may actually make mining financially unfeasible[^1].

**What's the average grade of all gold deposits in the world**

> In fact, in our 2013 report summarizing the world’s gold deposits, we found that the average grade of gold deposits in the world is around that amount: about 1.01 g/t.

### Gold purity

> Pure gold is extremely soft and malleable. It is because of this that manufacturers, typically jewellers, often mix or alloy pure gold with other harder base metals. Without knowing a gold article’s precious metal content it is difficult to arrive at a true valuation.
>
> To quantify this there are two major systems that measure purity. They are carat (karat in the US), and fineness. Both carat and fineness give figures that indicate the proportion of pure gold to other base metals in gold jewellery and products.

### Ounce and Troy Ounce

1 Troy Ounce == 31 grams == 0.031 kilo grams == 0.000031 ton
1 Ounce == 28 grams

When measuring precious metal we always use troy ounce.

### Density of gold

19.3 g/cc

or

19.3 ton/m^3

## How much gold has been discovered and how much has been mined?

By the estimation of the World Gold Council in 2019[^2], there are around 250,000 tonnes of gold, scattering around dozens of gold mines of the world, has been discovered, and by the end of 2019, 197,576 tonnes of gold has been mined throughout history, of which around two-thirds has been mined since 1950[^2]. **197,576** tonnes of gold corresponds to a 21.7 metre sides cube.

## Wait, are you saying all of the golds we have mined only fit a 21.7 metre sides cube?

Yes, 21.7 metre sides cube is roughly equal to 3 olympic standard pools, I could hardly believed it at first, but that's true. [Here](https://demonocracy.info/infographics/world/gold/gold.html)[^3] is a great visualization of how big a 21.7m^3 cube is, you might find yourself underestimate a 21.7m^3 cube there.

## Ok, then how much gold is still left there to be mined?

According to the above there are **~54,000** tonnes of gold is still left to be mined, so if people don't discover new gold mines, we may mine out the 54,000 tonnes of gold left in around 18 years. You may wonder how could it take so long time to be mined out, well, if you remember we have mentioned at the begining that the average grade of a gold mine is just 1.01g/ton, which means mining a ton of ore only gets 1.01 gram of gold. So a gold deposit costs decades to be carven out.

But note that **~54,000** is just the known estimated reserves, which means it's the discovered reserves. There are numerous undiscovered or unfeasible mines in the world, we have no idea how much gold is left in those reserves:

> It’s also important to remember that the total amount of gold in the Earth’s crust and the total amount that can be feasibly mined are not the same. There are almost certainly massive gold deposits deep beneath the surface of the Earth that are too far down to be detected, let alone extracted.
>
> Similarly, there are some known gold deposits in Antarctica that may never be economical to mine due to the continent’s extreme weather conditions and the challenges presented by thick ice layers.
>
> There is also a considerable amount of gold that cannot be collected profitably scattered throughout the world’s oceans. Much of these underwater deposits are contained within the ocean floor and floating as tiny particles in the seawater itself.[^4]

## How much gold is being mined each year?

> Each year, global gold mining adds approximately 2,500-3,000 tonnes to the overall above-ground stock of gold. While gold production has shown an upward trend in recent years, this is likely to level off in coming years.[^2]

## Top countires with the largest gold mine reserves in the world

Gold mine reserves means the unmined gold of the discovered deposits[^5]. By 2020 Australia holds the largest gold mine reserves[^6][^7], it is home to some of the biggest gold deposits in the world.

## Top countries with the largest gold reserves

This refers to how much gold a country's central bank holds, by 2020 USA is the top 1 with over 8000 tonnes of gold in its vaults[^8].
